\begin{document}

For a given $d$ that represents the radius of scanning, the number of words in
the word cloud is maximum $2d$ words.

$$ \forall c \in Clouds, w \in NonLocation \; || \{ w \; | \; w \in NonLocation
\; \wedge \; cloud.contains(w) \} || \leq 2d$$

If a word describes a location then it must be contained in the word cloud of
that location

$$ \forall word \in NonLocation, location \in Location $$
   $$ (word, location) \in describes \; \Leftrightarrow \;
   (word, has(location)) \in contains $$
