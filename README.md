CMPS 253 - Project 1
====================

The project consists of parsing a novel presented in a txt file then finding
out the author's opinion about all the locations mentioned. The program should
output a map in which a pin is displayed on all mentioned locations. Once a pin
is clicked the program should display the wordcloud characterizing the location.
A wordcloud will contain the words that the author used to describe a location.
